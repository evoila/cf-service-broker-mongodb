# cf-service-broker-core

This project provides core functionalities for Cloud Foundry Service Broker. It needs deployment services and a persistence service (see [evoila/cf-service-broker-deployment](https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-deployment) and [evoila/cf-service-broker-persistence](https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-persistence)) as well as a specific implementation of service binding routines for a specific service (for example see [evoila/cf-service-broker-example](https://github.com/evoila/cf-service-broker-example)).
